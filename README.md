# esports-data-analysis
This is a personal project I created to practice my data analysis skills.
<br><br>
Resources and Tech Used:
  - Kaggle
  - Jupyter Notebooks
  - NumPy 
  - Pandas 
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
<br>
In this notebook, the focus is on analysing the growth of the esports industry using the data provided for a limited time period (mainly when the esports industry actually caught the eye of everyone).
<br>
The notebook discusses the growth or general patterns in the esports industry based on several different factors like genre, release-year, etc.
<br><br>
I'm still in my learning phase for data analysis, therefore, this analysis can't be titled as the best or perfect one but just a practice project that helped me learn a lot along the way.
